# match_three
pygame to match falling bricks

Retro 8 bit style graphics and screen is only 640 by 480. As three blocks drop you can change the order. When they land if any three or more blocks match in
colour they disappear. If the screen fills up you lose. Each level gets faster and faster..

Written in Python using Pygame.
